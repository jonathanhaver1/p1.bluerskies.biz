			And here's something about myself:
		</p>

		<p>
			I love to work with individuals helping themselves in the personal and business areas.

			As a physician and therapist I have worked in outpatient and inpatient settings in leading Swiss hospitals and practices. In my work I became interested in communication and this is what I have worked in with people since.
		</p>

		<p>
			I went to Dartmouth College and hold a medical and a law degree. I trained in psychiatry and psychotherapy in Switzerland and studied coaching at the University of Cambridge (UK).

		<p>
			 I have published in the field of communication and self-improvement, and continuely hone my skills and experience in helping people and oprganizations
		</P>

		<p>
			I am using Sublime Text 2 as editor.

		<p>
			Once upon a time I cut a trailer for a film editing class for a film I had not even seen yet:
