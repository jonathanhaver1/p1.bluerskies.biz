			And here's something about myself:
		</p>

		<p>
			I love to work with individuals helping themselves in the personal and business areas.

			As a physician and therapist I have worked in outpatient and inpatient settings in leading Swiss hospitals and practices. In my work I became interested in communication and this is what I have worked in with people since. But I have also a background in film.
		</p>

		<p>
			I went to Dartmouth College and hold a medical and a law degree. I trained in psychiatry and psychotherapy in Switzerland and studied coaching at the University of Cambridge (UK).

		<p>
			 I have published in the field of communication and self-improvement, and continuely hone my skills and experience in helping people and organizations. I chaired the legal quality committee at a public insurance agency in Switzerland and with a colleague wrote the first quality report on the work of medical experts which became a template for organizations across Switzerland.  Last year I started with the support of colleagues a business which aims to help businesses and individuals in crisis situations and is attracting interest.
		</P>

		<p>
			I am using <span style="text-font:courier"><u>Sublime Text 2</u></span> as editor.

		<p>
			I am trying to put some extra features on this page:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li> I uploaded the first film I ever edited in a film editing class. It should probably be rate PG-13. Sorry, they did not give us "G" material, and as I said I still haven't seen the film yet.</li>
			<li> I tried to find some non-copyrighted music. Here you will see whether I have been successful.</li>
		</ol>

		<div id="menu">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="trailer.html">Let's see the Movie Trailer</a></li>
				<li><a href="poem.html">No, I would rather listen to some music</a></li>
			</ul>
