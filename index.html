		Hello and Welcome,

		My name is <span style ="font-family:cursive; font-size:135%">Jonathan</span> and this is my picture:

			And here's something about myself:
		</p>

		<p>
			I love to work with individuals helping them to improve and overcome crisis situations in business or personal situations. As a physician and therapist I have worked in outpatient and inpatient settings. In my work I became interested in communication between individuals and inside organizations. But I have also a background in film.
		</p>

		<p>
			I went to Dartmouth College and have been educated in medicine and in law. I trained in psychiatry and psychotherapy in Switzerland, and have now moved to Germany.

		<p>
			 I have published in the fields of communication, therapy and self-development. I chaired the legal quality committee at a public insurance agency in Switzerland and with a colleague wrote the first quality report on the work of medical experts which became a template for organizations across Switzerland. But since I am interest in working with individuals last year I started a business with the support of colleagues which aims to help individuals to overcome their difficulties, and this is where I would like to make more use of the internet and technology in general.
		</P>

		<p>
			I am quite new to setting up a website. Although I have been one of the first to use the internet as a ten year old from a homecomputer in the early 1980s, I have not made much use of it for a number of years. I am happy to be back.
		</p>

		<p>
			I like to read, go running and swimming, and going to the movies.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am using <span style="text-font:courier"><u>Sublime Text 2</u></span> as editor.
		</p>
		
		<form action="http://sublimetext.com">
    		<input type="submit" value="You can find Sublime Text here">
		</form>
		
		<p>
		However, I then switched to <u>Eclipse</u> because I had already been using it to do some Java programming and it is free. It is not as nice and slick as Sublime Text but I will try to give Eclipse a try. May I'll end up switching back again.
		</p>
		
		<form action="http://eclipse.org/eclipse">
    		<input type="submit" value="Go to Eclipse.com">
		</form>
		
		<p>
			If you install Eclipse you will also want to install the Web Development from Juno under Help -> Install new software ...
		</p>

		<p>
			Actually, I am now trying the two side by side, which is probably normal.
		</p>

		<div id="remark">
			I kept on getting errors when trying to save my HTML file until I noticed that the files were still open in my web browser. Just in case this happened to someone else as well. It was annoying until I figured it out.
		</div>

		<p>
			I am trying to put some extra features on this page:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li> I uploaded the first film I ever edited in a film editing class. It should probably be rate PG-13. Sorry, they did not give us "G" material, and as I said I still haven't seen the film yet.</li>
			<li> I tried to find some non-copyrighted music. Here you will see whether I have been successful.</li>
		</ol>

		<div id="menu">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="trailer.html">TRAILER</a></li>
				<li><a href="music.html">MUSIC</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
