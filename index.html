			My name is <span style ="font-family:cursive; font-size:135%">Jonathan</span> and this is my picture:

			And here's something about myself:
		</p>

		<p>
			I love to work with individuals helping them to improve and overcome difficult and crisis situations. As a physician and psychotherapist I have worked in outpatient and inpatient settings, as well as for public insurance agencies. Repeatedly I noticed the importance of communication, which I began studying in greater depth. My experience from working in crisis intervention and patient care also lead me to legal studies. Additionally I have a background in filmmaking. Writing on communication, therapy and self-development is something I enjoy.
		</p>

		<p>
			I went to Dartmouth College for my undergraduate education, and later studied medicine and law. I trained in psychiatry and psychotherapy in Switzerland, and have now moved to Germany.
		</p>

		<p>
			With the support of colleagues I started a business last year which aims to help individuals and organizations in difficult situations, and this is where I would like to make more use of the internet and technology in general.
		</P>

		<p>
			I am quite new to setting up a website, although I have been one of the first to use the internet as a ten year old from a homecomputer in the 1980s before the world wide web was around. Yes, I learned programming on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 and my first computer was a TRS-80.
		</p>

		<p>
			I like reading, running and swimming, and going to the movies.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am using <span style="text-font:courier"><u>Sublime Text 2</u></span> as editor.
		</p>
		
		<form action="http://sublimetext.com">
    		<input type="submit" value="You can find Sublime Text here">
		</form>
		
		<p>
			However, I then switched to <u>Eclipse</u> because I had already been using it to do some Java programming and it is free. It is not as nice and slick as Sublime Text but I will give Eclipse a try. May I'll end up switching back again.
		</p>
		
		<form action="http://eclipse.org/eclipse">
    		<input type="submit" value="Go to Eclipse.org">
		</form>
		
		<p>
			If you install Eclipse you will also want to install the Web Development from Juno under Help -> Install new software ...
		</p>

		<p>
			... oh and yes, I did switch back to Sublime Text again for working on these HTML pages.
		</p>

		<p>
			Actually, I am now trying the two side by side ...
		</p>

		<div id="remark">
			I kept on getting errors when trying to save my HTML file until I noticed that the files were still open in my web browser. Just in case this happened to someone else as well. It was annoying until I figured it out.
		</div>

		<p>
			I am trying to put some extra features on this website to try out a few things:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li> I uploaded the first film clip I edited in a film editing class. It should probably be rated PG-13. Sorry, they did not give us "G" material, and as I said I still haven't seen the film yet.</li>
			<li> I tried to find some non-copyrighted music. Here you will see whether I have been successful.</li>
		</ol>

		<div id="menu">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="trailer.html">TRAILER</a></li>
				<li><a href="music.html">MUSIC</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
